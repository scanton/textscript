TextScript the http://satori.actionscript.comAcitonScript Text Effects Engine by http://satoricanton.comSatori Canton.  This project is currently in active development in ActionScript 3.0 only.
ActionScript 2.0 and 1.0 implementations have not been in active development since 2006, however, are still used across the internet.  These libraries are also great examples for designers using the Flash IDE.  They are provided here mostly for long tail projects and designers that are looking for a quick and easy solution without the structure of ActionScript 3.0.

### TextScript 3.0 ###
The ActionScript 3.0 implementation of TextScript is available from the Google code subversion repository.  Click on the "Source" tab above to view download/viewing options.

A sample package using an alpha build of TextScript 3.0 from 2009 is available in our Downloads.
### TextScript 2.0 ###
A sample package using a beta/release build of TextScript 2.0 (for ActionScript 2.0) is available in our Downloads page.
### TextScript 1.0 ###
I'm still searching for the original TextScript package, originally developed for ActionScript.com around 2004-2005.  Once I find it, I'll post the archive here.  It's a very simple implementation of TextScript, very friendly to designers.
